# Gen AI Introduction

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence is about developing computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These include logical reasoning, natural language processing (NLP), and problem-solving.

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on building models which can learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

### ML Workflow
- Data preparation
- Model training
- Model evaluation

*The model's performance is directly proportional to the quality of the training data and how well it's trained.*

*f(x) = wx + b*

Where:
- `w` is the weight
- `b` is the bias
- `x` is the input


### Types of Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Self-Supervised Learning
- Semi-Supervised Learning

## Deep Learning (DL)

Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.

These models are good at handling large datasets, especially for tasks like image recognition, speech, and natural language understanding.

## Generative AI

Generative AI refers to AI systems that can generate text, images, audio, video, code, or any other media format based on some input.

Unlike traditional models that classify or predict, Gen AI models are designed to create new content.

Some examples:
- ChatGPT for text
- GitHub Copilot for code
- DALL·E and Midjourney for images
- Whisper and TTS models for speech

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are language models trained to predict the next word or token in a sentence. They are built using large amounts of text data and are fine-tuned to generate human-like responses.

These models use self-supervised learning. They are not just trained on inputs and outputs but on raw text data, learning patterns in language.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is a combination of:
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Natural Language Generation (NLG)

NLU focuses on understanding the context and intent behind the input.  
NLG focuses on generating meaningful responses or content.

## Examples of LLMs

| Provider   | Models                          |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| OpenAI     | GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, GTP-4o, GPT-o4 |
| Anthropic  | Claude 3, Claude 3.5 (Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus), Claude 3.7 Sonnet           |
| Google     | PaLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 pro |
| Meta       | LLaMA, LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, and Llama4|

## Multimodal AI (Text, Image, Speech)

Some newer models can handle more than one type of input or output. For example:

- GPT4o, GPT4, Claude 3.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet

**Other Models**

- Image generation: DALL·E, Midjourney
- Text to speech: ElevenLabs, Bark
- Speech to text: Whisper
- Text to video: Sora, Runway
